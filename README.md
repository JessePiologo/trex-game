# trex-game
This project was developed as a learning process and 
the main goal was to focus on functional requirements
based on the original application, the off-line T-rex Runner
game from Google Chrome.
Being so, I explored my coding skills on building what was needed
to achieve the most loyal possible as the original game is,
always looking forward to write clean code. Therefore some features
was later added to the original title which became slightly distinct.

Apart from the official game in which is written on JavaScrip
my version uses plain Java without help from any framework
through Android's platform.

A working copy is available at Google's Play Store under the name
"Meteor Runner" by the company "Piologo Games"
